**DeepDraw** is a ipython notebook example of generating class visualizations, such as the one above, from deep neural networks using [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/). The examples and settings in this notebook was based on the pretrained GoogLeNet model available with Caffe, but it's easy to modify to use other networks, such as AlexNet. For some more detailed information about how these class visualizations are generated, check out [this blogpost](http://auduno.com/post/125362849838/visualizing-googlenet-classes), and for some more examples of generated images, see <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/8qcvjnYBQVSGG2eN6">this</a> album of highlights or <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/FfsZZektqpZkdDnKA">this</a> album with all 1000 imagenet classes.

The repository also includes some code examples of *drawing* with the class visualizations, as described in [this blogpost](http://auduno.com/post/125837418083/drawing-with-googlenet), in the folder "/other".

To run the code in this repository, you'll need an installation of Caffe with built pycaffe libraries, as well as the python libraries numpy, scipy and PIL. For instructions on how to install Caffe and pycaffe, refer to the installation guide [here](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html). Before running the ipython notebooks, you'll also need to download the [bvlc_googlenet model](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master/models/bvlc_googlenet), and insert the path of the pycaffe installation into ```pycaffe_path``` and the model path to the googlenet model into ```model_path```.
